  <h4>What is phishing?</h4>
    
  <p>Unlike fishing that involves fish and a body of water, ‘phishing' is when criminals use scam emails, text messages or phone calls to trick their victims. The aim is often to make you visit a website, which may download a virus onto your computer, or steal bank details or other personal information.</p>
    
  <p>This page explains how to spot and report phishing attempts as well as protect yourself from scammers. </p>
  
  <h4>How to spot a scam email, text or call</h4>
    
  <p>Scammers try to quickly gain your trust. They aim to pressure you into acting without thinking.</p>
  
  <p>If a message or call makes you suspicious, stop, break the contact, and consider the language it uses. Scams often feature one or more of these 5 tell-tale signs:</p>
    <ul class="accordion-list single-active">
          <li class="accordion">
              <div class="title">
                  Authority
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                  Is the message claiming to be from someone official? For example, your bank, doctor, a solicitor, or a government department. Criminals often pretend to be important people or organisations to trick you into doing what they want.
              </div>
          </li>
          <li class="accordion">

              </div>
              <div class="content">
                  Are you told you have a limited time to respond (such as 'within 24 hours' or 'immediately')? Criminals often threaten you with fines or other negative consequences.
              </div>
          </li>
              <li class="accordion">

              </div>
              <div class="content">
                  Does the message make you panic, fearful, hopeful or curious? Criminals often use threatening language, make false claims of support, or tease you into wanting to find out
              </div>
          </li>

              </div>
              <div class="content">
                  Is the message offering something in short supply, like concert tickets, money or a cure for medical conditions? Fear of missing out on a good deal or opportunity can make you respond quickly.
              </div>
          </li>
              </li>
              <li class="accordion">

                  Current events
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                  Are you expecting to see a message like this? Criminals often exploit current news stories, big events or specific times of year (like tax reporting) to make their scam seem more relevant to you.

  <h4>How to check if a message is genuine</h4>
    
  <p>If you have any doubts about a message, contact the organisation directly. Don’t use the numbers or address in the message – use the details from their official website.
  Remember, your bank (or any other official source) will never ask you to supply personal information via email, or call and ask you to confirm your bank account details. If you suspect someone is not who they claim to be, hang up and contact the organisation directly. If you have paper statements or a credit card from the organisation, official contact details are often written on them.</p>
  
  <h4>How to report phishing scams</h4>
    
  <h5>Email</h5>
    
  <p>If you have received an email which you’re not quite sure about, forward it to <a href="mailto:report@phishing.gov.uk"> report@phishing.gov.uk</a>. Send emails that feel suspicious, even if you're not certain they're a scam because they can be professionally checked. Don't click on any links in a suspicious email. You don't need to forward us suspicious emails you find in your spam/junk folder.
  You can also report a scam using a screenshot of the email instead of forwarding.</p>
